# 🌸 Hello, problem-solver!  

Welcome to my little GitHub universe 🚀   

Here, spreadsheets turn into stories, dashboards drive smarter decisions, and SQL queries reveal insights hidden in plain sight.  

I’m **Ajmeri**, an aspiring **Business & Data Analyst** who loves digging through datasets, connecting the dots, and building visuals that make people say, *“Ohhh… now I get it!”*  

This isn’t just a collection of repositories.  
It’s a space where I’m growing my skills, solving real-world business problems, and sharing my journey—one dataset at a time.
