🌸 Hello, problem-solver!

Welcome to my GitHub universe 🚀

I’m Ajmeri, an aspiring Product Manager who loves turning data into product decisions. Here, I explore user behavior, analyze metrics, and build dashboards that help teams understand what works, what doesn’t, and why.

This isn’t just code and spreadsheets—it’s a space where I solve real-world product problems, test hypotheses, and extract actionable insights to drive better user experiences and business outcomes.

Every project here is a step in my journey to combine analytics, strategy, and product thinking into impactful solutions.
